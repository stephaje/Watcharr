# Contributing 🎉

First of all, thank you for looking into contributing! 🫡

Feel free to contribute in any way: 🐞 bug reports, 💡 ideas, 🥖 new features etc - everything is welcome!

For big PRs (lots of changes/big change in the way something works), if you'd like, it can be discussed first in an issue (dont want to waste anyones time!).

## Project Board

We have a [board to organize new features and bug fixes](https://github.com/orgs/sbondCo/projects/9/views/2) to be worked on. If you see something you'd like to work on, just ask in the issue and it can be assigned to you. Even if it isn't set for the next milestone already, it can be.
